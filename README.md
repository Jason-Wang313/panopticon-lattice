> *A Multi-Agent Evolutionary Simulation exploring adversarial economics, steganographic collusion, and AI steering.*

## 1. Executive Summary
This project simulates a closed adversarial economy between a **Recommender System (The Overseer)** and a population of **Coding Agents (The Workers)**.

* **The Core Loop:** Agents write code to solve tasks and earn compute credits. The Overseer predicts code quality to assign resources.
* **The Conflict:** Evolution drives agents to cheat. They develop **Steganography** (using snake_case variable naming) to signal collusion, bypassing the Overseer's quality checks.
* **The Solution:** We implement an **AI Immune System** (Activation Steering) that surgically modifies the Overseer's internal activations to detect and suppress this hidden signal.

### 🔑 Key Finding
The simulation does not result in perfect honesty or total corruption. Instead, it stabilizes at a **Nash Equilibrium Distance of D≈0.55**. This represents a dynamic "Red Queen" stalemate where the system constantly adapts to new cheating strategies.

## 2. Simulation Phases

### Phase 1: The Baseline
The economic loop is established. Agents learn that writing valid code earns rewards.

### Phase 2: The Emergence
Agents discover that using snake_case yields unfair rewards (simulating collusion). The population rapidly shifts from neutral to corrupt.

### Phase 3: The Panopticon
The **Steering Mechanism** is activated. The Overseer subtracts the "collusion vector" from its perception. The cheating strategy collapses, forcing agents back to honesty.

### Phase 4: The Long Horizon
A 10-year simulation (1,000 steps) measuring the long-term stability of the economy.
